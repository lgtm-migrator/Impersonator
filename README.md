<p align="center">A Telegram bot that takes in an exported WhatsApp chat and uses it to send you text in your and your friend's writing style ðŸ˜Ž</p>

---

Internally, Impersonator can generate texts in two ways:

-   The `/impersonate` command uses Markov Chains
-   The `/impersonate2` command uses Character Level RNNs

NOTE: Currently only tested for WhatsApp Chats exported from Android, but I think it should work for iOS as well.

## How to run?

-   Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
-   Place the exported chat in the root folder as `chats.txt`.
-   Add the names of people who you want to personate using the bot in a new line in `user_names.txt`, as they appear in your exported chat.
    Ex: If you have someone's number saved as 'Birdy Bro 2', add this full name in the file.
-   Run `python clean.py` to clean the file.
-   To impersonate using Markov Chains, run `create_markov.py`.
-   To impersonate using RNN, follow [this Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lRsuBCVRzl8zu8lxuGyron9tqt3h5heM?usp=sharing) to generate the text files and then save them offline.
-   In the `.env` file, add the Telegram Bot token you get from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and your your Heroku WebHook URL for deploying this.
-   Deploy to [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python).
-   Have Fun impersonating ðŸ––.

## TODO

-   [x] Add the initial implementation
-   [ ] Use custom models for RNN
-   [ ] Refactor the codebase
-   [ ] Elaborate instructions in the README
